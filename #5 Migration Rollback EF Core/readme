🧭 Command 1:
update-database -migration:0
✅ Meaning:
This rolls back all migrations, bringing your database back to the initial (empty) state, before any migrations were applied.
Equivalent to: "undo everything."
All tables and schema created by migrations will be dropped (as long as the migrations' Down() methods support that).

🧭 Command 2:
update-database 20251103115118_StudentTable
✅ Meaning:

This updates (or re-applies) your database up to a specific migration — here named 20251103115118_StudentTable.
It runs all migrations up to and including that one.
It’s commonly used after rolling back to 0, to reapply specific migrations selectively.

🧭 Command 3:
remove-migration

🧩 What It Does:
Deletes the most recent migration from your project’s Migrations folder.
Reverts any model snapshot changes (ModelSnapshot.cs).
It does not affect the database — only your code.
